A way to share notes for the other or just reminders for ourselves.


<------------------------SHIKHA NOTES------------------------>
I have created a sorting class, you can make the quick sort function in there. It creates two vectors, quick data and heap data, as copies of
searched data. I have not done any of the chrono stuff. We may have to change the format but we'll see after we finish sort

<----------------------GENERAL STRUCTURE --------------------->
the literal main function
- user interface
- constructs MOA
- while
  - prints and reads from CLI
  - calls MOA
  - print output


Class List and Purpose

Parsing- Reads data from the Excel file and creates vector of flight accident data entries (Shikha)

CLI- Reads in inputs from user through the command line (Jay)

MOA- the main chunk of the program, creates big vector, does search, sort and returns small SORTED vector to main function to be printed

Quick Sort Function- takes in a small unsorted vector and returns a big sorted vector (Jay)

Heap Sort Function- takes in a small unsorted vector and returns a big sorted vector (Shikha)

Search (maybe, cause it probably could be a function)- takes big vector and parameters returns small vector (Together)
 - could use a vector<pair<variable name, value>> to specificy which parameters
